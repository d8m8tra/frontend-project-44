# Automatic tests

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=d8m8tra_frontend-project-44&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=d8m8tra_frontend-project-44)

After completing all the steps in the project, automatic tests will become available to you. Tests are run on each commit - once all tasks in the Hexlet interface are completed, make a commit, and the tests will run automatically.

The hexlet-check.yml file is responsible for running these tests - do not delete this file, edit it, or rename the repository.
